# EEG-Driven Motion Diffusion Model

This repository contains the partial implementation of the EEG-Driven Motion Diffusion Model (EMDM), which generates human motion sequences based on EEG signals.

## Note

Currently, only a portion of the model code is available. The full code, including model training and evaluation scripts, along with the dataset, will be made publicly available once finalized.

## Environment

This project requires Python 3.7. To set up the environment, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file.

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3.7 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
