# EEG-Driven Motion Diffusion Model

This repository contains the partial implementation of the EEG-Driven Motion Diffusion Model (EMDM), which generates human motion sequences based on EEG signals.

## Note

Currently, only a portion of the model code is available. The full code, including model training and evaluation scripts, along with the dataset, will be made publicly available once finalized.
